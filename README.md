2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## Usage
- Run the main script or Jupyter notebook to train the recommender system and get book recommendations.

## Data Sources
- Dataset used for training: [BX-Books.csv](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ra4u12/bookrecommendation?select=BX-Books.csv), [BX-Users.csv](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ra4u12/bookrecommendation?select=BX-Users.csv), [BX-Book-Ratings.csv](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ra4u12/bookrecommendation?select=BX-Book-Ratings.csv).

## File Structure
#### The files in this repo are organised in this way:

- Three files, the main streamlit app, requirements and the colab notebook with the model itself.
